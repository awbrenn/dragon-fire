Computer Graphics (CPSC 6050) Project 2: Dragon Fire!


Professor:	Dr. Robert Geist
Team Members:	Austin Brennan, Yu Lee, Matthew Pfister
Due Date:	3/3/2016


Project Description:

This is a team project for a graduate level computer graphics course
at Clemson University. The goal is to get a better understanding of
OpenGL and GLSL (the OpenGL Shading Language).

Upon completion of this project, the program should be able to load a
complex dragon mesh into an OpenGL scene, and shade it using a
normalized Phong shader and 3-point lighting. The user should be able
to navigate the scene using the alt-key and a combination of mouse
clicks/movement (similiar to navigation in Maya or Unity).
